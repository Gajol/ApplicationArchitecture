Value Streams: See also [Scaled-Agile Framework - SAFe - Value Streams](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/value-streams/).  Agile Release Trains (ART) within each value stream develop the business solutions used by the operational value streams. ARTs are cross-functional and have all the capabilities—software, hardware, firmware, and other—needed to define, implement, test, deploy, release, and where applicable, operate solutions.
