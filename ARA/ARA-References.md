- [Management Theory - Human Side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_M._Juran) : Juran is widely credited for adding the human dimension to quality management. He pushed for the education and training of managers. For Juran, human relations problems were the ones to isolate, and resistance to change was the root cause of quality issues. Juran credits Margaret Mead's book *Cultural Patterns and Technical Change* for illuminating the core problem in reforming business quality. His book Managerial Breakthrough, published in 1964, outlined the issue.
