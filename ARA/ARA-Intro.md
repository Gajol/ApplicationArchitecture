# Introduction
This document outlines the Application Reference Architecture (ARA) as it applies to our department.  

What is architecture in general?  

- *Architecture is the stuff you canâ€™t Google.* - Mark Richards, O'Reilly
- *Architecture is the decisions that you wish you could get right early in a project, product or project lifecycle* - Ralph Johnson & Martin Fowler
- *Architecture is about the important stuff, whatever that is.* - Ralph Johnson & Martin Fowler


The Application Reference Architecture (ARA) borders on what many would consider an enterprise reference architecture.  This document, the ARA,  attempts to provide an overview of the enterprise environment with a focus on application architecture elements.

This document documents:
- existing application architecture within our department ???
- standards for technical leaders (mandatory)
- guidelines for technical leaders (voluntary)

This document is intended for:
- technical design leads
- technical development team

## Out-of-Scope
- This document is not intended to be a strategy development document.   The ARA is not intended to be a vision, plan or actions towards such a vision.
- The ARA is intended to align and support the many strategies, visions and roadmaps that exist within our department and branch.
