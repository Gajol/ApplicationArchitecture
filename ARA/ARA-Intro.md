# Introduction
This document outlines the Application Reference Architecture (ARA) as it applies to our department.  

What is architecture in general?  

- *Architecture is the stuff you canâ€™t Google.* - Mark Richards, O'Reilly
- *Architecture is the decisions that you wish you could get right early in a project, product or project lifecycle* - Ralph Johnson & Martin Fowler
- *Architecture is about the important stuff, whatever that is.* - Ralph Johnson & Martin Fowler


The Application Reference Architecture (ARA) borders on what many would consider an enterprise reference architecture.  This document, the ARA,  attempts to provide an overview of the enterprise environment with a focus on application architecture elements.
- Application architecture describes the behaviour of applications used in a business, focused on how they interact with each other and with users. It is focused on the data consumed and produced by applications rather than their internal structure. In application portfolio management, applications are mapped to business functions and processes as well as costs, functional quality and technical quality in order to assess the value provided." - *[Wikipedia - Application Architect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_architecture#Application_architect).*
- Enterprise architecture documents the whole architecture and all important elements of the respective organization, covering relevant domains such as business, digital, physical, or organizational; and ii) the relations and interactions between elements that belong to those domains, such as processes, functions, applications, events, data, or technologies." - *[Wikipedia - Enterprise Architect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_architecture)*.
