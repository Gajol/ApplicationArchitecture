# Business

Our department has a Business Capabiltiy Map (BCM) describing the main capabiliies required to fullfil our mandate.   To help support the busines our technology teams provide a broad range of IT capabilities.   Our IT department supports many networks both nationally and internationally.  Within the IT department, our software development team supports an extensive catalog of applications.

The health of our portfolio needs to improve as identified in our Corporate Risk Profile (CRP).   Several leadership principles have been established over the years to provide guidance when addressing business needs.   Key principles relating to directing architecture and design are:

1. Rationalization:  We have an long queue of valuable business requests and opportunities.   During the software development phase, requirements must be rationalized against the original approved project scope and other compete busines needs.  The costs of increment application development, both in project costs and ongoing costs must be carefully understood.  This is the process of rationalizing business needs and can include the senior management team when necessary.  [See Guidance - Rationalization for more informatoin - !!!]

1. Executive Lead / Change Management:  Projects and programs need executive sponsors who are committed to the change management and ratinalization required to allow IT to develop a product.

1. Business Architecture and Artefacts:  The business plays a key role in shaping the application.  For effective analysis of the business needs during application development the business should provide key business architecture input.  These are essential for a successful application and if unavailable will result significant architecture and design waste.  

  The following are useful:
  - Business Capability Model (BCM) - [[Wikipedia - Business Capability Model]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_capability_model) : A diagram that identifies the business capabilities with regards to the application being developed.   The GC BCM is a reference, and our department has an internal BCM.   The BCM traditional is decomposed into 3-4 levels with descriptions of each level.    The application requirements are mapped to the respective BCM capabilities.
  - Value Streams - [[Wikipedia - Value Streams]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_stream) : Introduced in Lean (1950's) a value stream is a set of actions (workflow) to produce value.  Value Stream Mapping [[Wikipedia - Value Stream Mapping]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping) is visual tool introduced in Lean Management methodology to display the value stream with define icons to show delays and inventory stages.   An example value stream might be recruitment "street to seat" or "hire to retire".  
  - Information Flows [[Wikipedia - Information Flow Diagram]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_flow_diagram) is a business view of how information flows between business responsiblity centres. *The main purpose of an information flow diagram is so that sources that send and receive information can be displayed neatly and analysed.*
  - Organization Model / Operating Model [[Wikipedia - Operating Model]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_model)- An operating model is both an abstract and visual representation (model) of how an organization delivers value to its customers or beneficiaries as well as how an organization actually runs itself.  The elements that make up the Operating Model are People, Process and Technology (PPT).  

  1. Business Requirements:  Business requirements for IT analysis, prioritization and design.  Business requirements should attempt to be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic/relevant and time-based [(SMART)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria).  By being SMART, this affords the technology project the ability to effectively plan and analyse.

## Technology Environment
Our IT operates in a complex constrained environment.
