# Business

The applications we develop support business models.  When an application is part of a business transformation or digital transformation initiative it is important to have a clear understanding of the businesses strategic direction.   Some common artifacts to communicate this are[^1]:

1. Business Glossary
1. Organizational Map
1. Business Capability Model (BCM) : identify and score capabilities against good system design quality attributes {performance, scalability, stability, monitorability, extensibility, security}
1. Process Maps and Re-engineer Processes : Consider [value streams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_stream).  Model process using BPMN.
1. Define the metrics : Identify what metrics can help assessment and reflection on desired business outcomes. These metrics must be possible to measure and communicate.
1. Understand the Governance Model: Governance is a meta-process. In your value stream, ask how decisions are made, who the authorities are, what roles they have, and what relevant review boards are.   Operational scorecards.
1. Business Architecture in Applications : What business strategy does this application map to?  Why does this project/application matter?  What new capabilities are you creating?  What major uses cases are performed?  Who are the audiences?

A common way for the business to communicate what the organization needs and does is through a business capability model (BCM). There are many uses for a BCM.   Product owners can use a BCM to drive convergence in technology and business processes to enterprise standards.   Regular review of aligning the BCM with the department strategy and vision can allow enterprise architects and business architects to identify and prioritize the corresponding IT initiatives with business needs.  Internal committees, working groups and forums can collaborate to identify reusable business process and push for adoption across the organization.  Business capabilities, processes, information flows and value streams should be assessed routinely based on efficiency, priority, and complexity.

Our department has a Business Capabiltiy Map (BCM) describing the main capabilities required to fulfill our mandate.   To help support the business our technology teams provide a broad range of IT capabilities.   Our IT department supports many networks both nationally and internationally.  Within the IT department, our software development team supports an extensive catalog of applications.

The health of our portfolio needs to improve as identified in our Corporate Risk Profile (CRP).   Several leadership principles have been established over the years to provide guidance when addressing business needs.   Key principles relating to directing architecture and design are:

1. Rationalization:  We have an long queue of valuable business requests and opportunities.   During the software development phase, requirements must be rationalized against the original approved project scope and other compete business needs.  The costs of increment application development, both in project costs and ongoing costs must be carefully understood.  This is the process of rationalizing business needs and can include the senior management team when necessary.  [See Guidance - Rationalization for more information - !!!]

1. Executive Lead / Change Management:  Projects and programs need executive sponsors who are committed to the change management and rationalization required to allow IT to develop a product.

1. Business Architecture and Artifacts:  The business plays a key role in shaping the application.  Business architecture (capabilities, value streams, information flows, organization model) are essential for successful analysis of the business needs during application development. Significant architecture re-work and design waste result if these are unavailable.

  The following are useful:
  - Business Capability Model (BCM) - [[Wikipedia - Business Capability Model]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_capability_model) : A diagram that identifies the business capabilities with regards to the application being developed.   The GC BCM is a reference, and our department has an internal BCM.   The BCM traditional is decomposed into 3-4 levels with descriptions of each level.    The application requirements are mapped to the respective BCM capabilities.
  - Value Streams - [[Wikipedia - Value Streams]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_stream) : Introduced in Lean (1950's) a value stream is a set of actions (workflow) to produce value.  Value Stream Mapping [[Wikipedia - Value Stream Mapping]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping) is visual tool introduced in Lean Management methodology to display the value stream with define icons to show delays and inventory stages.   An example value stream might be recruitment "street to seat" or "hire to retire".  
  - Information Flows [[Wikipedia - Information Flow Diagram]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_flow_diagram) is a business view of how information flows between business responsiblity centres. *The main purpose of an information flow diagram is so that sources that send and receive information can be displayed neatly and analysed.*
  - Organization Model / Operating Model [[Wikipedia - Operating Model]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_model)- An operating model is both an abstract and visual representation (model) of how an organization delivers value to its customers or beneficiaries as well as how an organization actually runs itself.  The elements that make up the Operating Model are People, Process and Technology (PPT).  

  1. Business Requirements:  Business requirements for IT analysis, prioritization and design.  Business requirements should attempt to be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic/relevant and time-based [(SMART)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria).  By being SMART, this affords the technology project the ability to effectively plan and analyse.

As our department adapts agile methodologies, incremental value in the project can be obtained by the agile team developing business artefacts.
