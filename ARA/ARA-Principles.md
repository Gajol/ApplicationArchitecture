# Principles

## Digital Transformation: Design Principles

The Government of Canada has identified the following digital architecture standards.  There are many sources for digital principles[^Principles-1].    The standards/principles are in support of the Digital Operations Strategic Plan.

Application architecture should include these as over-arching guidelines.



| Principle                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :--------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use Open Standards and Solutions by Default          | Open Source, Prioritize (open source, COTS, custom), contribute to open-source                                                                                                                   |
| Maximize Reuse, Reuse and Improve                    | Leverage existing solutions, minimize duplication.                                                                                                                                               |
| Design for Users First                               | User-centered methods, focus on users, using agile.                                                                                                                                               |
| Deliver with Multidisciplinary Teams                 | Include all skillsets required for delivery                                                                                                                                                      |
| Design for Performance, Availability and Scalability | Design quality into the system.  Use distributed systems (assume failure will happen)                                                                                                            |
| Enable Interoperability                              | Expose functionality as a service.  Use microservices built around business capabilities.  Scope each service to a single purpose.  Use APIs.  Use the Canadian Digital Exchange Platform (CDXP) |
| Design Systems to be Measurable and Accountable      | Publish Service Level Agreements (SLAs), Make an audit trail for all transactions (traceability).                                                                                                |
| Keep Data Organized                                  | Decouple master data from applications.  Make systems of record (SOR) authoritative sources, use Master Data Management (MDM)                                                                    |
| Use Cloud First                                      | Use SaaS -> PaaS -> IaaS                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Design for Security and Privacy                      | Categorize data, perform privacy impact assessment (PIA) on personally identifiable information (PII)                                                                                            |

#### GC DOSP
The GC Digital Operations Strategic Plan[^Principles-DOSP] indicates the priorities for services/applications should be, '*developing and delivering services that, by design, put users first by being accessible, inclusive, secure and easy to use, and that respect privacy and choice of official language*.
