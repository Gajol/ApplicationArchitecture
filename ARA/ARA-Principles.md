| Use Open Standards and Solutions by Default          | Open Source, Prioritize (open source, COTS, custom), contribute to open-source |
| Maximize Reuse, Reuse and Improve                    | Leverage existing solutions, minimize duplication.           |
| Design for Users First                               | User-centred methods, focus on users, using agile.           |
| Deliver with Multidisciplinary Teams                 | Include all skillsets required for delivery.  Collaborate widely. |
| Design for Performance, Availability and Scalability | Design quality into the system.  Use distributed systems (assume failure will happen) |

| Enable Interoperability                              | Expose functionality as a service.  Use microservices built around business capabilities.  Scope each service to a single purpose.  Use APIs.  Use the Canadian Digital Exchange Platform (CDXP) |
| Design Systems to be Measurable and Accountable      | Publish Service Level Agreements (SLAs), Make an audit trail for all transactions (traceability). |
| Keep Data Organized                                  | Decouple master data from applications.  Make systems of record (SOR) authoritative sources, use Master Data Management (MDM) |
| Use Cloud First                                      | Use SaaS -> PaaS -> IaaS                                     |
| Design for Security and Privacy                      | Categorize data, perform privacy impact assessment (PIA) on personally identifiable information (PII) |

#### GC DOSP
The GC Digital Operations Strategic Plan[^Principles-DOSP] indicates the priorities for services/applications should be, '*developing and delivering services that, by design, put users first by being accessible, inclusive, secure and easy to use, and that respect privacy and choice of official language*.
