# Definitions
## Architecture

|Term|Definition|
|--|----|
|Application|An application, application program or application software is a computer program designed to help people perform an activity|
|Application Architecture (GC EARB)|Application Architecture consists of the interaction of applications with each other and with users. It focuses less on internal mechanics and specific programming and more on overall design on how data is consumed and created by the system. It views the interactions between applications, databases, middleware to ensure scalability, reliability, availability and manageability.|
|Architecture Style|The combination of distinctive features related to the specific context within which architecture is performed or expressed; a collection of principles and characteristics that steer or constrain how an architecture is formed. (TOGAF)|
|Architecture Types/Domains|The overall architecture of an enterprise can be described by integrated sub-architecture domains. These are; Business, Application, Information, Technology, Security, Privacy and Data Architecture|
|Architecture Characteristics|Architecture characteristics are the aspects the system must do that is not directly related to the domain functionality. These are often called non-functional requirements but should be considered as Quality Requirements. An architectural characteristics of concern influences some aspect of the design, and is critical/important to the application's success.|

## Application  Platforms
An application platform provides an environment for software to be executed.

|Discipline or Platform|Definition|Example Products|
|--|----|---|
|Low Code Application|A platform which allows for the creation of applications with little to no code.|Mendix, ServiceNow, Outsystems, Salesforce|
|Business Process Management|A platform which support business processes throught workflows, processes, orchestration and monitoring|Pega Platform, Microsoft Dynamics|
|Robotic Process Automation|A tool which can automation repeated manual tasks.|uiPath|

## Application Web Frameworks
An application framework is a software framework used by software developers following a standard structure supported by the framework.  StackOverflow annual survey identifies the top software languages, databases, web frameworks and tools. - [*2021 StackOverflow 2021 Survey*](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology).


|Framework|Definition|Examples|
|--|----|--|
|Application Framework|Software framework for enterprise applications|Spring's framework is used to create Java-based enterprise applications.  .Net is Microsoft led framework (free and open-source).|
|Front-End Frameworks|Create and provide the aesthetics, the user experience, and the visual appeal of web applications|React.js, JQuery, Angular, Vue.js|
|Back-End Frameworks|Provides the framework for the aspects the user does not see, typcially on a server. APIs, dbs, search, caching are common functions|Nodejs, Spring, Ruby on Rails|



## Application - Cloud Platforms
For the ARA, in 2022, our applications are primarily non-cloud based.  Teh Government of Canada uses Azure.

## Technology Stacks

|Stack|Expansion|
|--|----|
|LAMP|Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP|
|MEAN|MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js|

## Application Components

There are many groups of terms relating to applications and application development.

|Term|Definition|
|--|----|
|API|An application programming interface (API) is a connection between computers or between computer programs. An API is a software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software.  An API may be a web-service call (REST API, ...) or a software library or framework (function calls, methods, libraries, ...).|
|Front-End & Back-End|In simple application terms, the front-end of an application is concerned with the presentation to the end-user. In simple application terms, the back-end interacts with the data access layer.|
|Web Service|An API to invoke a service over a network.  Many different standards exist for web service APIs (Service Oriented Architecture - SOA and SOAP, REST API, CORBA). gRPC is newer option (2015) using HTTP and ProtoBuf; while more complex than REST APIs, offers programatic interface description language.   gRPC is often used in micro-service architectures.|

## Application Portfolio Management
Application Portfolio Management (APM) is used by enterprises to manage the lifecyle of applications.  The key goals of APM are to provide oversight to manager risks, reduce costs and make strategic investment decisions.   Some common terms are:

|Term|Definition|
|--|----|
|Application Life Cycle|The stages of an application.  Four stages are commonly used; 1) governance (decision-making stakeholders decided to create an application; 2) development (the process of creating an application), 3) testing and 4) operations and maintenance.  
|Technical Debt|Technical debt is the coding you must do tomorrow because you took a shortcut in order to deliver the software today.|
|IT Governance| IT governance is processes that enable the IT staff to better manage risk and operate efficiently to the benefit of the organization on the whole.|
|Critical Service|A critical service is one that, if disrupted, would result in a high or very high degree of injury to the health, safety, security or economic well-being of Canadians, or to the effective functioning of the Government of Canada.|
