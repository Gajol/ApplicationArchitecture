# Creating an Architecture Strategy : Guidance

The architectural strategy for a program; whether they are renewal efforts (ERP, HR, IM, Collaboration) or greenfield (Case Management) should follow methodologies proven to be successful.

The guidance below is a summary of __Technology Strategy Patterns__.[^1].   This guidance is aimed at larger program initiatives that span multiple-years.   Our past history on programs (operations, collaboration, administrative) show these initiatives span five or more years before a minimal vialbe product (MVP) is in production.

## Apply Patterns to Formulate a Strategy
  - Context:  Trends, Constraints, Stakeholders
  - Understand:  Research, analyse and understand your stakeholders, the environment and the technology landscape.
  - Options: Identify options in the products, services and technology roadmaps
  - Analysis: Analyse options.
  - Recommendation:  Make recommendation and obtain approval.


## Design Thinking
Use design-thinking in the cross-functional project team to arrive at appropriate architectures .  
The steps in design thinking are:
1. Define the Problem
1. Make Observations : determine users, observe user's actions, create personas
1. Form Insights
1. Frame Opportunities
1. Generate Ideas
1. Refine Solutions
1. Try Prototypes

### Design thinking principles:
1. Human-centricity
1. Showing, not-telling
1. Clarification
1. Experimentation
1. Collaboration
