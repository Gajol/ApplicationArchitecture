# Creating an Architecture Strategy : Guidance

XXX - This is WEAK - XXX

The architectural strategy for a program; whether they are renewal efforts (ERP, HR, IM, Collaboration) or greenfield (Case Management) should follow methodologies proven to be successful.

The guidance below is a summary of __Technology Strategy Patterns__.[^1].   This guidance is written for architects, product managers, technology managers, and executives to help develop larger application program strategies.   Our past history on programs (operations, collaboration, administrative) shows we consistently require five or more years before a minimal viable product (MVP) is in production. This books provides patterns to drive strategy, similar to how software design patterns like decorator and factory are used in software development.



## Apply Patterns to Formulate a Strategy
1. Context:  Trends, Constraints, Stakeholders
1. Understand:  Research, analyze and understand your stakeholders, the environment and the technology landscape.
1. Options: Identify options in the products, services and technology roadmaps
1. Analysis: Analyze options.
1. Recommendation:  Make recommendation and obtain approval.


## Design Thinking

Use design-thinking in the cross-functional project team to arrive at appropriate architectures .  
The steps in design thinking are:

1. Define the Problem
1. Make Observations : determine users, observe user's actions, create personas
1. Form Insights
1. Frame Opportunities
1. Generate Ideas
1. Refine Solutions
1. Try Prototypes

### Design thinking principles:
1. Human-centricity
1. Showing, not-telling
1. Clarification
1. Experimentation
1. Collaboration

## Patterns

### Corporate Level Patterns
- Stakeholder Alignment : influence/impact matric to determine their role in projects (maintain confidence, collaborate, keep informed, monitor)
- RACI
- Life-Cycle Stage : more aligned for companies and their stage of product and market maturity
- Value Chain : identify where value is created
- Growth-Share Matrix
- Core/Innovation Wave : identify funding based on core to business, and how innovative (complex) the technology is.
- Investment Map : difficulty and readiness, do the easy and ready ones.


### Department Level Patterns

| Level            | Pattern                                | Description                                                                        |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Department Level | Principles, Practices, Tools           | Define principles aligned to vision.                                               |
|                  | Current and Future Model               | Focus on key value derived from LEAN Six Sigma, process mapping and value streams. |
|                  | Process Posture Map                    | Categorize processes by Start, Continue, Invest, Assess, Revise                    |
|                  | Business Process Mapping               | Draw out process using BPMN                                                        |
|                  | Application Portfolio Management (APM) | Value, Cost, Risk awareness.                                                       |
|                  | Capability Mapping                     |                                                                                    |
