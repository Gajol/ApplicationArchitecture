# Creating an Architecture Strategy : Guidance

The architectural strategy for a program; whether they are renewal efforts (ERP, HR, IM, Collaboration) or greenfield (Case Management) should follow methodologies proven to be successful.

The guidance below is a summary of __Technology Strategy Patterns__.[^1]

## Apply Patterns to Formulate a Strategy
  - Context:  Trends, Constraints, Stakeholders
  - Understand:  Research, analyse and understand your stakeholders, the environment and the technology landscape.
  - Options: Identify options in the products, services and technology roadmaps
  - Analysis: Analyse options.
  - Recommendation:  Make recommendation and obtain approval.

## Concerns of an Architect
  - Contain entropy:  Show a path in a roadmap; garnering support for that vision through communication of guidelines and standards; and creating clarity to ensure efficiency of execution and that you’re doing the right things and doing things right.
  - Specify Non-Functional Requirements / Quality Requirements: The "..ility" list.   scalability, availability, maintainability, manageability, monitorability, extensibility, interoperability, portability, security, accessibility, observability, conformity (laws, directives). [Wikipedia - Quality Attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes)
  - Determine trade-offs: Identity the least-bad option.

1. Patterns / Tools
Many tools exist to perform options analysis.  Most start with creating an hypothesis and then validating (or invalidating) it formally.

Some tools suggested are:
- Logic Tree
- SWOT - Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats


## Corporate (Enterprise) Context
Use design-thinking in the cross-functional project team to arrive at appropriate architectures .  
The steps in design thinking are:
1. Define the Problem
1. Make Observations : determine users, observe user's actions, create personas
1. Form Insights
1. Frame Opportunities
1. Generate Ideas
1. Refine Solutions
1. Try Prototypes

### Design thinking principles:
1. Human-centricity
1. Showing, not-telling
1. Clarification
1. Experimentation
1. Collaboration
