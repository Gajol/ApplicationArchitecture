## Discovery

There are many initiatives within our department that require enterprise and domain architecture effort to recommend the path forward.

1. Identity and Access Management (IdAM):  
Analyze existing identity and access management options to provide multi-domain identity and access to compartmentalized information.


1. Enterprise Integrations & Interoperability:  
Analyze steps to mature our ability create a composable enterprise [Gartner] with an focus on leveraging modern API concepts (API management, API catalog, API developer experience - sandbox, versioning, ...).


1. Enterprise Search:  
Gartner calls the broader enterprise search an Insight Engine. [Gartner - Critical Capabilities for an Insight Engine](https://www.gartner.com/document/4000026?ref=solrAll&refval=312773615).  [[Gartner Magic Quadrant - Insight Engines]](https://www.gartner.com/document/3999454?ref=ddisp&refval=4000026).  Key terms include; connectors, touch points, integrations.  Popular open-source solutions like Solr and Elastic support API integrations for adding and removing content with structured-metadata.   A key to the success of enterprise search is the ability to structure the index information with metadata.  This enables discover and faceted searches.

1. Multi-Security Zone Applications:  
Our directorate has been asked to to move workloads to lower security zones.  As a consequence business processes may span security zones.  The cross-domain-solution has been identified as an enabler technology.  What overall application, data, information and security architecture is needed to realize these benefits.    

1. Managing Media
Our department manages multimedia (images, audio and video files) as well as file-types on a diverse range of applications.  Media management can be addressed be a Media Management Platform and a Digital Experience Platform (DXP).  Industry leaders include OpenText, Oracle and Salesforce.  While some Content Management Systems (CMS) also support DXP features many new market entrants are SaaS-based and require cloud connectivity (e.g, Sanity.io).   OpenText DXP() is not in the top-magic quadrant; however it deserves consideration due to GCdocs.
- [OpenText DXP](https://www.opentext.com/products-and-solutions/products/customer-experience-management/digital-experience-platform)
- [Opentext Why you Need a DXP](https://blogs.opentext.com/digital-experience-platform/): *Orchestrating a cohesive, contextual experience that meets brand standards, achieves business goals across all channels and touchpoints, while it delights the recipient, is a massively difficult task.*

Features of a DXP:
- Content Management System
- Media Asset Management
- Digital Asset Management (media and non-media content)
- Headless DXP / CMS : Provide back-end features expose media assets via API's.
