## Discovery

There are many initiatives within our department that require enterprise and domain architecture effort to recommend the path forward.  

### Identity and Access Management (IdAM)

Analyze existing identity and access management options to provide multi-domain identity and access to highly  compartmentalized information.  Identify options for securing compartmentalized information while allowing information to be easily shared across business-domains (operational data and operation administration).  For example, research how *drag-and-drop* be simplified.  There are no known industry patterns for this (e.g., Google's Zanzibar for photo-sharing lacks the features required in our drag-and-drop problem space).

### Multi-Security Zone Applications

Our directorate has been asked to to move workloads to lower security zones.  As a consequence business processes may span security zones.  The cross-domain-solution has been identified as an enabler technology.  What overall application, data, information and security architecture is needed to realize these benefits.    

### Managing Media

Our department manages multimedia (images, audio and video files) as well as file-types on a diverse range of applications.  Media management can be addressed be a Media Management Platform and a Digital Experience Platform (DXP).  Industry leaders include OpenText, Oracle and Salesforce.  While some Content Management Systems (CMS) also support DXP features many new market entrants are SaaS-based and require cloud connectivity (e.g, Sanity.io).   

OpenText DXP is not in the top-magic quadrant; however it deserves consideration due to  GCdocs being based on OpenText.

- [Opentext Why you Need a DXP](https://blogs.opentext.com/digital-experience-platform/): *Orchestrating a cohesive, contextual experience that meets brand standards, achieves business goals across all channels and touchpoints, while it delights the recipient, is a massively difficult task.*

Features of a DXP:
- Content Management System
- Media Asset Management
- Digital Asset Management (media and non-media content)
- Headless DXP / CMS : Provide back-end features expose media assets via API's.
