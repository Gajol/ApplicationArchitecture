Choosing an API Format: REST Using OpenAPI
Specification, GraphQL, gRPC or AsyncAPI
Published 21 February 2022 - ID G00760366 - 33 min read

RESTful APIs remain the most widely used and supported API style and the OpenAPI
Specification (OAS) is widely considered to be the standard format for defining
them.
■
Organizations seeking to maximize the effectiveness of their APIs for specific use
cases are increasingly adopting alternative approaches including GraphQL, gRPC
and AsyncAPI.
■
GraphQL usage is growing fast and is a good fit for connecting mobile and web user
interfaces. Its use cases are also expanding to include data publication and
normalization of diverse back-end APIs.
■
gRPC is widely used for interservice communication where its strong typing,
performance and procedural style are a good fit for software engineers building both
services and microservices. It is rarely used for externally or internally published APIs
focused on integration.
■
AsyncAPI is the least mature, but is gaining vendor support. It is used as an easier
and more consistent way to define asynchronous APIs events and messages in a
protocol-agnostic format.
