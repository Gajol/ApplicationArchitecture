TOGAF : The Open Group Architecture Framework.  TOGAF is one of many architecture frameworks.  In the mid-2000's the Government of Canada and Shared Services Canada were using TOGAF as their reference arcitecture framework.   Today, the GC CIO and EARB do not appear to have identified a formal architecture framework.
