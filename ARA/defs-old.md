Governa
    - Governance, derived from the Greek word kubernan (to steer) is an important responsibility of the architect role. As the name implies, the scope of architecture governance covers any aspect of the software development process that architects (including roles like enterprise architects) want to exert an influence upon. For example, ensuring software quality within an organization falls under the heading of architectural governance because it falls within the scope of architecture, and negligence can lead to disastrous quality problems.

Characteristics
- Architecture characteristics are the aspects the system must do that is not directly related to the domain functionality. We often call these non-functional requirements; however I would prefer to use the term Quality Requirements.  Characteristics have three criteria: 1) specifies a non-domain (non-functional) consideration, 2) influences some aspect of the design, and 3) is critical/important to the application's success. A few are listed below [[Richards, Mark. & Ford, Neil. Fundamentals of software architecture: an engineering approach. (O’Reilly, 2020) - Chapter 4.
