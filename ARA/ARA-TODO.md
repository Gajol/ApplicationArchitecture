Bear in mind that the more heavyweight and prescriptive the framework is, the less well-suited it is to agile development. If your internal processes call for you to create detailed architecture documentation in the early phases of a development effort, then they’re not agile.*

## Enterprise Overview

### Guidelines

#### Security : Shift-Left
Engage Security early.  Inform security early of the technology you are planning on using, and how you are address common security requirements (identity, access, monitoring, auditing, patching, ...).  There are many other security families, and including security and recording joint, collaborative decisions is important in avoiding the discovery of major security risks later in the project.

#### System Architecture
##### Loosely Coupled
Resources: Domain Driven Design : Domain Driven Design can help decompose a system into loosely coupled components: how to draw boundaries between services, how to decide whether some logic belongs to one service or another, and how domain-driven design can help us make those decisions.   

### Design Methodolgoy??
#### User Experience
Embrace GC User Centric Design
- [Nielsen Norman Group - Maturity Model](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-maturity-model/)

|Maturity Level|Description|
|--|--|
|Absent|UX is ignored or nonexistent.|
|Limited|UX work is rare, done haphazardly, and lacking importance.|
|Emergent|The UX work is functional and promising but done inconsistently and inefficiently.|
|Structured|The organization has semi-systematic UX-related methodology that is widespread, but with varying degrees of effectiveness and efficiency.|
|Integrated|UX work is comprehensive, effective, and pervasive.|
|User-Driven|Dedication to UX at all levels leads to deep insights and exceptional user-centered–design outcomes.|

4 high-level factors that contribute to the organization’s UX maturity [NNG - UX Factors to Success](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/factors-ux-maturity/)
1. Strategy: UX leadership, planning, and resource prioritization (vision, planning, budget)
1. Culture: Knowledge about and attitudes towards UX, as well as cultivating UX careers and practitioners’ growth. (awareness, appreciation, competencys, adaptability)
1. Process: Systematic, efficient use of UX research and design methods (methods, collaboration, consistency)
1. Outcomes: Intentional definition of goals and measurement of the results produced by UX work (impact of design, measurement)


### UX Design

### Observability

Observability:  This is an entire field of its own, and has gained momentum with microservices.

## Example Problems
### Enterprise Search
Problem:  Enterprise Search has access to all corporate information.   Display search results, and provide information to the user must respect security and privacy concerns.   Applications with local access-business logic, and big-data platforms are difficult to expose to enterprise search.
Challenges:
1. Granularity:  field-level access, crawl PDFs (and other filetypes), ...
1. Discoverability:  search
1. Search Relevance:
 1. Precision : Precision is the percentage of documents in the result set that are relevant.  Find relevant documents, with very few irrelevant documents.
 1. Recall : Recall is the percentage of relevant documents that are returned in the result set.  Recall means the number of documents retrieved that are relevant, divided by the number of total relevant documents.
1. Saved Search : Ability of saving a search and working through the search results, refining search (eDiscovery)

## Data Availability
Problem:  Corporate solutions (ERP, HR, S-app, Collab-platforms) have silos of data which is unavailable for easy use by other applications.
Guideline:  "Application data must be made available to other applications in a controlled fashion".
- Controlled Fashion : respecting IM and security concerns.   Exposing data in a modern manner (distributed architecture, API).

## Framework for Data Governance
Problem:  Data governance, business and technical processes to provide a version of truth of the system, or, system of record.
Example:  Entity Resolves / Unresolves.  The business-activity is unrestrained, and the application that performs the resolution action does not generate meaningful data such that a reliable API can be defined to identify a resource.  The system of record is unaware of these activities.  The SoR does not have API to identity the identity of the entity, nor, a means to notify on changes to the core entity's identity.
Impact:  An external application consuming this information has developed business logic to arbitrate entities, and, has nightly jobs to re-validate the integrity of its business logic.
Resolutions:  Identify a system of record for entities and ensure the business logic for this responsibility is contained within this system.
Technologies that can help:   Data governance, Master Data Management.
Software Architecture Patterns that can help:  
- [Bounded Context](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html)
- [Domain Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) : DDD model of the entity (our Entity), events on the entity (resolve / unresolve)  and aggregates which are only permitted to contain references to the root of the entity.
Challenge:  Unsure how MDM can solve Analytics Platform resolve/unresolve process.

## Distributed Multi-Security-Zone Business Process
Problem: We are starting to use SaaS application providers, however, due to privacy and security concerns we cannot put sensitive information in the SaaS application.   As a result, business process will involve using systems on both the high and low security zones.  Business users will have to learn to complete processes using tokenized, masked and redacted information.   IT will have to provide technology to move and transform the data between these systems.  This design constraint will impact the user experience.  IT's role is to implement technology to facilitate these multi-zone business processes, while reamining loosely coupled with the SaaS solution (important as the SaaS solution is upgraded regularly beyond the control of the business or IT).
Guideline:  
- TBD:  Patterns include EDA, distributed architecture
Decisions:
- business logic will not reside on the low side.   All integration business logic will be on the high-side.

## Terms
- Application:
- System:
- Solution:

- Reference Architecture : A reference architecture is a document or set of documents that provides recommended structures and integrations of IT products and services to form a solution. The reference architecture embodies accepted industry best practices, typically suggesting the optimal delivery method for specific technologies.  A reference architecture in the field of software architecture or enterprise architecture provides a template solution for an architecture for a particular domain.  A lower level one might demonstrate the interactions of procedures (or methods) within a computer program defined to perform a very specific task.
 - A Reference Architecture is created by capturing the essentials of existing architectures and by taking into account future needs and opportunities, ranging from specific technologies, to patterns to business models and market segments. [Reference: THe Gaudi Project - Netherlands](https://gaudisite.nl/GaudiProject.html)





## CNA
- CNA: Cloud-native architecture and technologies are an approach to designing, constructing, and operating workloads that are built in the cloud and take full advantage of the cloud computing model.
- Kubernetes is a platform to manage, host, scale, and deploy containers.
- Containers are a portable way of packaging and running code. They are well suited to the microservices pattern, where each microservice can run in its own container.

## Thoughts - Describe TRB / AWG differences
- key - TRB is agile - share early, quickly, often and informally...get guidance...

Unstructured Knowledge Sharing:
- team-based knowledge sharing meetings where the purpose is to share and discuss (some TRB meetings have this as the key-goal)
- open office hours for any questions
- lunch & learn presentation series
- show & tell / demonstrations  
- peer learning groups : learning (small, L&D type activities), guided learning
