## Enterprise Overview

### Guidelines

#### Security : Shift-Left
Engage Security early.  Inform security early of the technology you are planning on using, and how you are address common security requirements (identity, access, monitoring, auditing, patching, ...).  There are many other security families, and including security and recording joint, collaborative decisions is important in avoiding the discovery of major security risks later in the project.

#### System Architecture
##### Loosely Coupled
Resources: Domain Driven Design : Domain Driven Design can help decompose a system into loosely coupled components: how to draw boundaries between services, how to decide whether some logic belongs to one service or another, and how domain-driven design can help us make those decisions.   

### Design Methodolgoy??
#### User Experience
Embrace GC User Centric Design
- [Nielsen Norman Group - Maturity Model](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-maturity-model/)

|Maturity Level|Description|
|--|--|
|Absent|UX is ignored or nonexistent.|
|Limited|UX work is rare, done haphazardly, and lacking importance.|
|Emergent|The UX work is functional and promising but done inconsistently and inefficiently.|
|Structured|The organization has semi-systematic UX-related methodology that is widespread, but with varying degrees of effectiveness and efficiency.|
|Integrated|UX work is comprehensive, effective, and pervasive.|
|User-Driven|Dedication to UX at all levels leads to deep insights and exceptional user-centeredâ€“design outcomes.|

4 high-level factors that contribute to the organizationâ€™s UX maturity [NNG - UX Factors to Success](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/factors-ux-maturity/)
1. Strategy: UX leadership, planning, and resource prioritization (vision, planning, budget)
1. Culture: Knowledge about and attitudes towards UX, as well as cultivating UX careers and practitionersâ€™ growth. (awareness, appreciation, competencys, adaptability)
1. Process: Systematic, efficient use of UX research and design methods (methods, collaboration, consistency)
1. Outcomes: Intentional definition of goals and measurement of the results produced by UX work (impact of design, measurement)


### UX Design

## Example Problems
### Enterprise Search
Problem:  Enterprise Search has access to all corporate information.   Display search results, and provide information to the user must respect security and privacy concerns.   Applications with local access-business logic, and big-data platforms are difficult to expose to enterprise search.
Challenges:
1. Granularity:  field-level access, crawl PDFs (and other filetypes), ...
1. Discoverability:  search
1. Search Relevance:
 1. Precision : Precision is the percentage of documents in the result set that are relevant.  Find relevant documents, with very few irrelevant documents.
 1. Recall : Recall is the percentage of relevant documents that are returned in the result set.  Recall means the number of documents retrieved that are relevant, divided by the number of total relevant documents.
1. Saved Search : Ability of saving a search and working through the search results, refining search (eDiscovery)

? What is ElasticSI (elastic search + ??) - cloud based search : https://elastic-si.com/



## Data Availability
Problem:  Corporate solutions (ERP, HR, S-app, Collab-platforms) have silos of data which is unavailable for easy use by other applications.
Guideline:  "Application data must be made available to other applications in a controlled fashion".
- Controlled Fashion : respecting IM and security concerns.   Exposing data in a modern manner (distributed architecture, API).

## Framework for Data Governance
Problem:  Data governance, business and technical processes to provide a version of truth of the system, or, system of record.
Example:  Entity Resolves / Unresolves.  The business-activity is unrestrained, and the application that performs the resolution action does not generate meaningful data such that a reliable API can be defined to identify a resource.  The system of record is unaware of these activities.  The SoR does not have API to identity the identity of the entity, nor, a means to notify on changes to the core entity's identity.
Impact:  An external application consuming this information has developed business logic to arbitrate entities, and, has nightly jobs to re-validate the integrity of its business logic.
Resolutions:  Identify a system of record for entities and ensure the business logic for this responsibility is contained within this system.
Technologies that can help:   Data governance, Master Data Management.
Software Architecture Patterns that can help:  
- [Bounded Context](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html)
- [Domain Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) : DDD model of the entity (our Entity), events on the entity (resolve / unresolve)  and aggregates which are only permitted to contain references to the root of the entity.
Challenge:  Unsure how MDM can solve Analytics Platform resolve/unresolve process.

## Distributed Multi-Security-Zone Business Process
Problem: We are starting to use SaaS application providers, however, due to privacy and security concerns we cannot put sensitive information in the SaaS application.   As a result, business process will involve using systems on both the high and low security zones.  Business users will have to learn to complete processes using tokenized, masked and redacted information.   IT will have to provide technology to move and transform the data between these systems.  This design constraint will impact the user experience.  IT's role is to implement technology to facilitate these multi-zone business processes, while reamining loosely coupled with the SaaS solution (important as the SaaS solution is upgraded regularly beyond the control of the business or IT).
Guideline:  
- TBD:  Patterns include EDA, distributed architecture
Decisions:
- business logic will not reside on the low side.   All integration business logic will be on the high-side.

- Solution:

- Reference Architecture : A reference architecture is a document or set of documents that provides recommended structures and integrations of IT products and services to form a solution. The reference architecture embodies accepted industry best practices, typically suggesting the optimal delivery method for specific technologies.  A reference architecture in the field of software architecture or enterprise architecture provides a template solution for an architecture for a particular domain.  A lower level one might demonstrate the interactions of procedures (or methods) within a computer program defined to perform a very specific task.
 - A Reference Architecture is created by capturing the essentials of existing architectures and by taking into account future needs and opportunities, ranging from specific technologies, to patterns to business models and market segments. [Reference: THe Gaudi Project - Netherlands](https://gaudisite.nl/GaudiProject.html)





## CNA
- CNA: Cloud-native architecture and technologies are an approach to designing, constructing, and operating workloads that are built in the cloud and take full advantage of the cloud computing model.
- Kubernetes is a platform to manage, host, scale, and deploy containers.
- Containers are a portable way of packaging and running code. They are well suited to the microservices pattern, where each microservice can run in its own container.

If it was, it may have eroded beyond recognition. Programmers with a shred of architectural sensibility shun these quagmires. Only those who are unconcerned about architecture, and, perhaps, are comfortable with the inertia of the day-to-day chore of patching the holes in these failing dikes, are content to work on such systems.

# Goals

## Goal : Enterprise Search


## Goal: Reduce Content Duplication with URL Design

Content (information) is duplicated within applications and across technologies.  The causes of this have not been formally documented, however some factors leading to users copying content are the lack of *trust* in being able to find or access the content in the future.  This can be paraphrased as *I need a local copy for me or my team*.   This leads to copies of information on shared-drives and transitory and corporate applications.   

Some historical examples that have led to this "clone-and-own" culture include:

  - Link Rot:  Application upgrades making links to content fail.   [Deep Linking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_linking) is the use of a hyperlink that links to a specific, generally searchable or indexed, piece of web content on a website.  For example, a link to a specific case, request or document.  

  - Access:  Users are concerned that the content may disappear due to the content owner removing, renaming or modifying user-access.   This is difficult to address at the application layer, and requires enterprise information and access-management governance.


1. URL Lifecycle
 When supporting [Deep Linking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_linking) design must take into account the lifecycle of the link, ned that the content may disappear due to the content owner removing, renaming or modifying userand its ability to function through upgrades.   Consider patterns such as [Permalink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink) and Data Object Identifier [(DOI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier).  When provide a link to a user for reference, identify this should be a trusted-link which survives upgrades/replacements.

1. URL Design
 Define a URL strategy for the application, including an inventory or URL's provided.  Define the manner in which URLs are clean, friendly and pretty [Clean URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL); support *http://example.com/name* as opposed to *http://example.com/index.php?page=name*.

## Goal : Composable ERP and HR Enterprise - Gartner

  [Gartner - The Future of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is Composable](https://www.gartner.com/document/3991664)[^Guidance-9] defines a *Composable ERP* as an adaptive technology strategy that enables the foundational administrative and operational digital capabilities for an enterprise to keep up with the pace of business change. This strategy delivers a core of composable applications and, as a service, software platforms that are highly configurable, interoperable, and flexible to adapt to future modern technology.  

  The key Gartner recommendations are valid for ERP and HR modernization initiatives:
  - [ ]  Define business capabilities through road mapping exercises
  - [ ]  Reduce reliance on customizations and proprietary-ERP
  - [ ]  Continuously deliver incremental business value in a modular mode
  - [ ]  Build an ERP team with wide-ranging skills (Adopt a DevOps for ERP). Ensure adequate skill development and training

## Concerns of an Architect
  - Contain entropy:  Show a path in a roadmap; garnering support for that vision through communication of guidelines and standards; and creating clarity to ensure efficiency of execution and that youâ€™re doing the right things and doing things right.
  - Specify Non-Functional Requirements / Quality Requirements: The "..ility" list.   scalability, availability, maintainability, manageability, monitorability, extensibility, interoperability, portability, security, accessibility, observability, conformity (laws, directives). [Wikipedia - Quality Attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes)
  - Determine trade-offs: Identity the least-bad option.

1. Patterns / Tools
Many tools exist to perform options analysis.  Most start with creating an hypothesis and then validating (or invalidating) it formally.

Some tools suggested are:
- Logic Tree
- SWOT - Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats
