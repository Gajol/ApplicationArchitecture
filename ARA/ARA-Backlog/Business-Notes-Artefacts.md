# Business

The business plays a key role in shaping the application.  For effective analysis of the business needs during application development the business should provide key business architecture input.  The following are useful:
business capability model (BCM) - [[Wikipedia - Business Capability Model]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_capability_model) : A diagram that identifies the business capabilities with regards to the application being developed.   The GC BCM is a reference, and our department has an internal BCM.   The BCM traditional is decomposed into 3-4 levels with descriptions of each level.    The application requirements are mapped to the respective BCM capabilities.
Value Streams - [[Wikipedia - Value Streams]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_stream) : Introduced in Lean (1950's) a value stream is a set of actions (workflow) to produce value.  Value Stream Mapping [[Wikipedia - Value Stream Mapping]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping) is visual tool introduced in Lean Management methodology to display the value stream with define icons to show delays and inventory stages.   An example value stream might be recruitment "street to seat" or "hire to retire".   
Information Flows [[Wikipedia - Information Flow Diagram]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_flow_diagram) is a business view of how information flows between business responsiblity centres. *The main purpose of an information flow diagram is so that sources that send and receive information can be displayed neatly and analysed.*
Organization Model / Operating Model [[Wikipedia - Operating Model]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_model)- An operating model is both an abstract and visual representation (model) of how an organization delivers value to its customers or beneficiaries as well as how an organization actually runs itself.  The elements that make up the Operating Model are People, Process and Technology (PPT).

Value Streams: See also [Scaled-Agile Framework - SAFe - Value Streams](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/value-streams/).  Agile Release Trains (ART) within each value stream develop the business solutions used by the operational value streams. ARTs are cross-functional and have all the capabilities—software, hardware, firmware, and other—needed to define, implement, test, deploy, release, and where applicable, operate solutions.
