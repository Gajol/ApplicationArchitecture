# Architecture Strategy

## Creating a Strategy
The architectural strategy for a program; whether they are renewal efforts (ERP, HR, IM, Collaboration) or greenfield (Case Management) should follow methodologies proven to be successful.

The guidance below is a summary of __Technology Strategy Patterns__. [[Hewitt, E. Technology strategy patterns: architecture as strategy. (O’Reilly, 2018)](http://www.worldcat.org/isbn/978-1-4920-4087-3)]

### Apply Patterns to Formulate a Strategy
  - Context:  Trends, Constraints, Stakeholders
  - Understand:  Research, analyse and understand your stakeholders, the environment and the technology landscape.
  - Options: Identify options in the products, services and technology roadmaps
  - Analysis: Analyse options.
  - Recommendation:  Make recommendation and obtain approval.

### Concerns of an Architect
  - Contain entropy:  Show a path in a roadmap; garnering support for that vision through communication of guidelines and standards; and creating clarity to ensure efficiency of execution and that you’re doing the right things and doing things right.
  - Specify Non-Functional Requirements / Quality Requirements: The "..ility" list.   scalability, availability, maintainability, manageability, monitorability, extensibility, interoperability, portability, security, accessibility, observability, conformity (laws, directives). [Wikipedia - Quality Attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes)
  - Determine trade-offs: Identity the least-bad option.

1. Patterns / Tools
The book goes in significant theory like propositional theory; and are aimed more at the private and political sectors.  The intent is to create an hypothesis and then validate it formally.

Some tools suggested are:
- Logic Tree
- SWOT - Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats
- [Ansoff Growth Matrix - Harvard Business Review 1957](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansoff_matrix) : 2X2 matrix with Market and Products with values of Current/New.

|Ansoff Growth Matrix|Market-Current|Market-New|
|--|--|--|
|__Product__|__New__|__Current__|
|__New__|Market Development Strategy: Develop new markets for new products|Diversification Strategy: Develop new products in new markets|
|__Current__|Market Penetration Strategy: Gain market share with current products and market|Product Development Strategy:  Develop new products in current markets.|

### Corporate (Enterprise) Context
Position the enterprise for competitive advantage.
- Stakeholder Alignment : A top-down approach, determine the organization chart, and *determine what leaders at the VP, Senior Director, and/or Director level matter in terms of your strategy*.  Based on the stakeholder matrix determine their influence and impact and associate an approach to working with them (monitor, keep informed, maintain confidence, collaborate).
- RACI
- Life-Cycle Stage
- Value Chain : Identify where value is created (hint: legal, intrastructure, IT, HR, procurement are supporting the value chain.).  Maximize efficiency and value.
- Growth-Share Matrix
- Core/Innovation Wave
- Investment Map
