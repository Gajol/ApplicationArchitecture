# Goals for Business Architecture

Although beyond the scope of this document, product development can be vastly improved when business architecture is developed alongside the application. This section provides some high-level guidance reference Government of Canada directions as appropriate.

## Guidance: Create an Business Architecture Strategy

The architectural strategy for a program; whether they are renewal efforts (ERP, HR, IM, Collaboration) or greenfield (Case Management) should follow methodologies proven to be successful.

The following artifacts, described earlier in the *Business* section, can be evolved throughout the agile product development by the inclusion in sprint cycles and demonstrations.

1. Organizational Map
1. Business Capability Model (BCM)
1. Process Maps
1. Business Metrics
1. Governance Model
1. Business Architecture in Applications


## Guidance: Incorporate Design Thinking in Transformational Programs

Use design-thinking in the cross-functional project team to arrive at appropriate architectures.   The steps in design thinking are:

1. Define the Problem
1. Make Observations : determine users, observe user's actions, create personas
1. Form Insights
1. Frame Opportunities
1. Generate Ideas
1. Refine Solutions
1. Try Prototypes

### Design thinking principles:
1. Human-centricity
1. Showing, not-telling
1. Clarification
1. Experimentation
1. Collaboration

## Guidance; Incorporate Systems Thinking in Transformational Programs

Systems Theory in engineering considers both the business and the technical needs of all customers, with the goal of providing a quality product that meets the user's needs.   Systems thinking, draws on this theory, and provides a perspective of seeing and understanding systems as wholes rather than as collections of parts. A whole is a web of interconnections that creates emerging patterns. – [Peter Senge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Senge) and the book [The Fifth Discipline - 1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Senge)

Why use Systems Thinking?
- To find the most important places for intervention to change the long‐term behaviour of a system.
- Systems thinking is based on user-centric design principles.  
- Government of Canada Digital Operations Strategic Plan directs departments to use user-centric design.
- Government of Canada Digital Standards directs departments to design with users.

Systems Thinking - 4 Fundamental Concepts
1. Interconnectedness
1. Synthesis
1. Feedback Loops
1. Causality

Analysis : Analysis Is about dissection of complexity into manageable components. Analysis fits into the mechanical and reductionist worldview, where the world is broken down into parts.  (Analysis looks into things.)

Synthesis : Is about understanding the whole and the parts at the same time, along with the relationships and the connections that make up the dynamics of the whole. (Synthesis looks out of things.)

Approach
1. Identify a system
1. Explain the behaviour or properties of the whole system (Synthesis)
1. Explain the behaviour or properties

Questions to ask:
1. What depends on what?
1. What is causing what?
1. Where are the information flows?
1. Where control decisions are made?
1. What information flows are critical?
1. How to best engage stakeholders?
1. How best to manage or intervene in the system for desired result?

Tools
1. brainstorming tools
1. dynamic thinking tool
1. structural thinking tools
1. computer based tools
