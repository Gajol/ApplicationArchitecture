# Patterns
Patterns are known, proven solutions.  Patterns help us communicate architecture and design to each other.

Drive strategy with patterns.
- application architecture patterns
- software design patterns : Decorator, Factory, Visitor, Pub/Sub, ..
- user experience patterns


# Architecture Styles

Big Ball of Mud - Anti-Pattern:
An application without structure, software making direct database calls, with no concerns for deisgn.  In 1997, Brian Foote and Joseph Yoder, coined this the Big Ball of Mud:

```
A Big Ball of Mud is a haphazardly structured, sprawling, sloppy, duct-tape-and-baling-wire, spaghetti-code jungle. These systems show unmistakable signs of unregulated growth, and repeated, expedient repair. Information is shared promiscuously among distant elements of the system, often to the point where nearly all the important information becomes global or duplicated.

The overall structure of the system may never have been well defined.
-Based Application
*TODO* Streaming-Ready/capable application

If it was, it may have eroded beyond recognition. Programmers with a shred of architectural sensibility shun these quagmires. Only those who are unconcerned about architecture, and, perhaps, are comfortable with the inertia of the day-to-day chore of patching the holes in these failing dikes, are content to work on such systems.
```


## User Experience Patterns
Many patterns exist for a successful user-experience (search, navigation, filters, comparisons, grids, ...)
