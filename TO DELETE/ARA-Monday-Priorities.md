CQRS Principle - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation#Command_query_responsibility_segregation

It states that every method should either be a command that performs an action, or a query that returns data to the caller, but not both. In other words, asking a question should not change the answer.[1] More formally, methods should return a value only if they are referentially transparent and hence possess no side effects.
